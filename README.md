# MultispeciesOpt
 Optimising distance sampling surveys for more than one species

This repository holds the code for analyses presented in Chapter 3 of my thesis: Application of optimised distance sampling in multispecies surveys (Kathryn Knights, University of Melbourne, 2024).

Folder structure should be as follows:

(working directory is the main repository, top level)
dataRaw
scripts

All analyses and graphs in the thesis chapter can be recreated from scripts in the scripts/folder.

Analysis of the case study is based on data in the file dataRaw/distance_Kath_2018_DataDecky.csv
The script scripts/caseStudyVars.R produces the dataframe caseStudyVals, containing the estimates in Table 3.1.

Graphs 3.1 to 3.3 are produced in the file scripts/varEffectsAlphaAB.R, graphs 4 and 5 are produced in the file scripts/panelGraphs.R.

This is an archived version of the code, and is not intended for use or distribution.
